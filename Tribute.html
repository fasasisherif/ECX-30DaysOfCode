<p>The love ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚ù§Ô∏è  I have for my sister is greater than all the seven oceans joined.
She has been my backbone since I was born.
I love her dearly.</p>
<p>Dear, Ummu Asma Azizat ,This website is specially made for you. You are a patient, good, hardworking and loving sister.</p>
<p>I remember when we were young, you used to tell me stories in the evening. I looked forward to them.</p>
<p>You infected me with the hobby of reading novels. I've have read many books all thanks to you. I remember that everyday you took me home from school in my primary school days.
And at home she helped with my home-works.</p>

<p>You showed me how to cook a bunch of foods which I couldn't have learnt elsewhere unless I want to pay.</p>
<p>Thanks to you I can make confectioneries and our everyday foods.</p>
<p>You advised me to go to Adams college when my grades we're nothing to write home about.
That is one of the best advice you give me.
I love you so much.</p>
